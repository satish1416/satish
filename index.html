		<h2>THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A F*CK</h2>
		<img src="book1.jpg">
		<p id="main-article-text">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is a book about finding meaning in important things in life and only having those values that an individual can control. Whatever value (such as popularity) that is not under a person's control, is a bad value to have and a person should strive to replace it with something more controllable such as punctuality, honesty, or kindness. </p>

		<h5>About</h5>
		<p id="main-about-text">This Website provides you an opportunity to prove and show your hidden talent on writing books.
			Writing a book is hard without the right help. Without someone who’s done it before, you can end up making crucial mistakes.

You decided to write a book. Maybe you have the perfect idea (so you think, but we’ll get to that), have always wanted to write one, and just aren’t sure where the heck to get started!

The process of writing and publishing a book successfully is so much more than just writing and pushing a button to publish on Amazon.

Anyone who says learning how to write a book is easy has never actually tried. If they did, they’d know writing a book takes a lot more than a helpful piece of grammar software.

It takes help from someone who’s done it before.

Which is why I’m weighing in, having written and published 6 bestselling books and replicated my process across thousands of students through our Become a Bestseller program.

Let’s save you a ton of time, and many headaches, and dive into how to write a book.

If you’ve ever tried to write a book, you know how it goes…

You stare at a blank page for 5 minutes, but it feels like hours. To combat the boredom, you stand, stretch, and brew yet another pot of coffee.

And…a week later someone asks how your book is coming, and you think, “Book? What book? I haven’t even come up with a book idea yet!”

But now you’re ready to start writing a book—and we’re going to help make sure you do.</p>
